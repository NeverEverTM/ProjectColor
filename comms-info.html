            Questions & Answers
        </h1>
        <h2>How do I contact you?</h2>
        <div>
            If you go up, you will see the <img src="img/icons/icon_contacts.png" alt="icon contacts" width="18"
                height="18"> Contacts tab,
            from there you can reach me through direct messages on Discord, Bluesky and/or Devianart.
        </div>
        <h2>How much does the art cost change if I need XYZ thing?</h2>
        <div>
            This depends widly on a few different factors, specifics can be asked with no problem.
            Something like a sticker pack won't cost several hundred dollars but the complexity of the requirements may
            up the price
        </div>
        <h2>Can I hire you for XYZ project that I'm working for?</h2>
        <div>
            I'm up for hire if pay and conditions are fair and square.
            I don't do free jobs, nor I want to participate in your fan project if is not in my field of interests.
            If you want to do a collab of some sorts, first ask me directly if I'm free and interested in joining.
        </div>
        <h2>Do you do <span class="highlight">art trades/requests</span>?</h2>
        <div>
            If I'm free, I am always up for a trade, requests not so much. Just don't expect me to say yes to all
            trades.
        </div>
        <h2>Can I draw your characters?</h2>
        <div>
            Go ahead! Just let me know so I can see it! I love people doing my goobers.
        </div>
        <h2>How do I pay you?/Can I pay you in Virtual Currencies/Steam Games/Nitro</h2>
        <div>
            For now I can only accept payments through Paypal, I will think to set up another ways for people unable to
            do so through this way.
            I do <span style="color: red;">not</span> accept alternative ways of payment, SPECIALLY for virtual
            currencies.
            No devianart points, no robux, no discord nitro. I cannot properly control these and will only put you and
            me at risk.
        </div>
        <h2>Can I share the pieces I paid for?</h2>
        <div>
            Yes! You have full control of your piece, wheter or not you want to credit me is up to you, however there is
            a few exceptions.
            You cannot claim you have made the piece, you cannot use it for AI training/NFT minting and you cannot use
            it for commercial use*.
            If my art is used as a front for controversial topics such as hate crimes, you will be blacklisted. I do not
            condone any kind of violent or abusive behaviour.
            <br>
            <br>
            (*Depending on the case, an agreement needs to be reached beforehand)
        </div>
        <h2>Do you draw NSFW/suggestive art?</h2>
        <div>
            I do <span style="color: red;">not</span> do either NSFW or highly suggestive pieces, what counts as
            suggestive should be as simple as thinking straight for a moment,
            but if you are still not sure, you can ask me directly. If you are a minor, I will automatically deny you
            any kind of request of this type, plus be more strict about it.
        </div>
        <h2>Your art is too expensive, can't you do me a free one?</h2>
        <div>
            No, if you want a piece, save up money, don't come and ask for free art.
            I am already working in the lowest price ranges so I would appreciate it if you gave me a chance regardless.
        </div>
        <h2>What is your favorite food?</h2>
        <div>
            Ol'good Pepperoni Pizza
        </div>
    </div>
