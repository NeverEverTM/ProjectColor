        Hello! I'm Never, solo game developer in-training, currently developing two titles:
        <span class="highlight">A Light Away</span>, a linear story-driven precision platformer with a (hopefully) fully working level editor.
        And <span class="highlight">Firelight</span>, an action adventure bullet-hell metroidvania.

        A lot of my time is spent this two things, mainly because of my ample free time between college,
        I started this web-blog to centralize all related media that I work on, less personal projects, more commercial games.
            
        Here I will try sharing details and behind the scenes, aswell as to drop off my thoughts during development,
        Soon enough, I will set a <span class="highlight">Kofi</span> and <span class="highlight">Itch.io</span> pages so look up for that!
        regardless, you are still able to drop feedback or complains at our <span class="highlight">discord server</span> linked right above here.

        <pre>
        Mainly known as NeverEver(TM) but my name is Summer.

        I have done a few things on modding and some silly projects, it is now that I have taken more seriously my career.
        Big fan of how games are done, and have studied closely how to develop a game 
        (But actions speak louder than words so here I come!)
