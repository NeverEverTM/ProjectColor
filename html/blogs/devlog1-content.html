            From my roots in game dev, I always took inspiration from the games that started the projects,
        for once, Firelight wasnt really meant to be any more complicated than simple shapes, 
        in my own note proposal it said something along the lines of:
    </pre>
    <h4 class="container-purple" style="text-align: center;">
        "Metroidvania white and black, simplistic, top down shooter, bullet hell, basic shapes"
    </h4>
    <pre class="content-text">

        The original focus of the story was wholly different to what has been wrote down now,
        however, I am not talking about that right now. Lets get into the inspirations</pre>

    <pre class="content-text">
            Some of the major inspirations for Firelight are Hollow Knight, Bug Fables and Crosscode,
        this first two in particular for story and art, which is quite suprising considering they are quite opposites.


            On one side, Hollow Knight is a somber, dark and hopeless place, the fallen kingdom of Hallownest,
        slowly rotting away, which shows through the beautiful backgrounds and scenes that the game plays at,
        from the abandoned City of Tears to the eerie quiteness of the Resting Grounds.

            On the other hand, Bug Fables, now, that is not to say this game doesnt have its dark parts,
        but most of the time, its a lighthearted fun and exciting story about a trio of explorers
        trying to obtain an ancient treasure through the colorful kingdom of Bugaria.

        And Firelight fits between these two.

    <h2 id = "Lumi" class="header-article">The Kingdom Of Firelight<a href="#Lumi" title="Article Link">¶</a></h2>
    <div style="display: flex;justify-content: space-between;">
        <pre class="content-text">
            Lumi (from the literal word, Luminescence) is a kingdom that was born from the fight of two races,
        the Wasp kingdom and the Bee kingdom, ultimately setting out their differences and interests,
        the game takes place a few many years after this, which means damage is still to be healed.
    
        Though, before these two settled, a long time ago, another civilzation rised, fell, and was forgotten
        by the time it was discovered.
    

            My goal for Lumi is to turn it into a place of regrets and hope, 
        two elements that fit with one of the main story beats of finding ones identity, 
        which Toffee goes through the game.
    
        But along the way, the people you met, and the bonds that are born,
        Lumi doesnt burst with joy, but neiter does it give up.
    
            
            This was also a rather short article, but I wanted to get something out there for once,
        next month, I may talk about character inspirations, or how the gameplay works as of now.

        And with that, good night.
