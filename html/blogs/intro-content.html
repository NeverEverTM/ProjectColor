        This is not the first time I do this introduction.<br>
        <br>
        Welcome to my little hidding spot! Here I will finally comment on some 
        development hurdles of mine,<br>as well as share some personal thoughts from time to time.<br>
        This place was meant to be a long time ago but due to difficulties, it was left unsupervised.<br>
        With it now open, I plan on doing monthly updates on logs, wheter it be
        the most interesting thing you ever saw or me coding the settings menu.<br>
        <br>
        There is not much around to look at, but with this opening, TWO devlogs will
        be available as of now,<br>one detailing some art style choices and early concepts, and
        the other is me just going over one important but basic gameplay mechanic to come forward.<br>
        <br>
        Sorry, there is no comments in this site. If you want to talk, use the <span class="highlight-link" onclick="BodyManager.ChangeCategory('contacts')">Contacts</span> tab.
