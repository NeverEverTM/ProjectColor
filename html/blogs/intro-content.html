        This is not the first time I do this introduction.
        
        Welcome to my little hidding spot! Here I will finally comment on some 
        development hurdles of mine, as well as share some personal thoughts from time to time.
        This place was meant to be a long time ago but due to difficulties, it was left unsupervised.
        With it now open, I plan on doing monthly updates on logs, wheter it be
        the most interesting thing you ever saw or me coding the settings menu.

        There is not much around to look at, but with this opening, TWO devlogs will be available as of now,
        one detailing some art style choices and early concepts, and
        the other is me just going over one important but basic gameplay mechanic to come forward.

        Sorry, there is no comments in this site. If you want to talk, use the <span class="highlight-link" onclick="BodyManager.ChangeCategory('contacts')">Contacts</span> tab.
