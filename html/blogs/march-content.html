        Im delaying everything in March to April, hopefully. I hate doing this but I rather not do things half baked.
        My original plan was to release the Aphid Festival Resort demo by the 25,  and it should still be close all things considered.
        
        <span class="highlight">What about the tech blog?</span>
        Same deal, I have been working on both things and I cant showcase what I would have wanted.
        So Im hoping to deliver it next month.

        TL;DR Sorry I couldnt bring anything this month
        Take care yall
