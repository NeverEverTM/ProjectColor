    Well, it punishes you for certain things...
    Maybe it sets you back in time to do something right.
    Maybe it takes away some of your resources control your playstyle.
    Or prevents you from getting somewhere bad!
    In this case, I want the player to avoid reckless play or to head first into dangerous areas.


    This doesnt mean I dont want the player to play aggresively or instead with extreme caution,
    just enough danger so that they think twice how to confront following unexplored rooms.

    This takes me to my first example, Hollow Knight, if you may not know it (Most likely, yes), it is also a metroidvania,
    in this game, the player dying not only means that they are going back to their last checkpoint,
    which may not be close if they havent found one, but also lose hold of <span class="highlight">ALL their money and 1/3 of their maximum energy</span>.

    This death takes the form of a ghost that stays in the room you died at,
    it will attack if approached, but killing it gives you back everything
    however, failing to kill this ghost before you die again means all the money will be <span class="highlight">permanently lost</span>,
    not only does the death make you a tad more "vulnerable" but also pressures you into, well, not dying much.


    As second example, I have a recently played one, Laika: Aged Through Blood. Also metroid<strike>motor</strike>vania.
    Here, dying is fairly a common occurence, but it does not go unpunished.
    
    You have money bags, that you drop on death, you start with two and craft more along the way,
    you can lose as many bags as you want, but once you ran out of them, the oldest one will be <span class="highlight">deleted</span>.
    However, each death only takes a percentage of your money (Rather big, but not all), 
    and the game offers a buff system. One of the effects (magnetism) makes recollecting the bags a lot easier,
    thus making it rarely a problem, apart from early on.
    
    And thats when I thought...

    It got me thinking, and ultimately, I decided to combine both of these.
    
    So my concept for this is, on death the player drops a bag of sorts, that will contain the following:
    - <span class="highlight">30% of their money, max health and max power</span>
    If you die again, you lose the money part, lost stats would scale with your current one
    (aka if you have 9 at first, you lose 3, then 2, then 1), now, of course this wont repeat to infinity
    not only a limit on lost stat will be put, but here is the kicker:
    <span class="highlight">Lost max health and power are turned into temporary health and power</span>, meaning it can be used up once.
    
    This stacks up with deaths, which means <span class="highlight">you respawn fully max healed and with some extra power</span>,
    but makes you more vulnerable during active combat, as it cannot be gained back.
    I believe it may make death a lil more exciting, but this is just a concept,
    and it may end up being stripped of the stat part as I see fit, you never know with this crazy ideas.
    But what do you think?

    
    That would be it for this article, I honestly talked more about other games than mine,
    so here is a participation award for ya.
