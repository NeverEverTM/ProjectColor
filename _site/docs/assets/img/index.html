            A legend as old as time and space themselves
            A power that could transcend reality. The legend of the crystal cores
            Eight brave heroes stood against its growing bitterness
            They used their souls to contain the ravaneous aura that irradiated
            And were spread across the universes so it would never fall on the wrong hands
            So the knowledge of its location and powers were lost to the sands of time
            Until one fateful day...
