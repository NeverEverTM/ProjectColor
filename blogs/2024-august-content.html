    We arrive at the end of August and so with it, a brand new news news update...
    news.
</p>

<h2>
    Aphid Festival Resort
</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        I will be uploading and doing a public betatest for 1.3.
        This will not only hopefully help me solve some problems under my conern,
        but also highlight areas for polish.
        Once the month is done, I'm hopeful to release the stable version. So reach
        me out if you have some feedback or bug report to hand during this period.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apart from that, here is some highlights:
    </p>
    <div class="inner-div">
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Build feature is now complete:tm:</span><br>
            You can buy furniture and open your storage to place it, all done from the free camera (press Q)
            While holding, press E to put back in storage, press R to sell (for half the cost)
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Visual Update</span><br>
            A lot of things have been redraw to just look a tiny teeny little better, more animations
            have been made, with hella more frames, along with some neat menu animations.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Map Revamp</span><br>
            Reduced the dead space of the resort by a loooot, you can start seeing some places
            of interest here and there, maybe a bit empty still but that is on the way.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Screenies</span><br>
            I mentioned this twice already, so just a reminder.
        </p>

        <p>
            Along the testing period, I will also introduce the long promised batch of goodies
            to spice up the current content.
        </p>

<h2>Firelight</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Guess who has not collected the footage yet.
        Most of the work is unremarkable, as in "me being dumb and fixing dumb mistakes at 2am"
        so the most I can offer of comfort is that enemies sprites are being implemented.
    
        If you see this, please go bother and tell me to work in Firelight, between AFR
        and other things I never get the time to work it meaningfully.
    </p>

        I have no more things to say, next month university starts again. I have a job
        to worry about, lots of things, but I appreciate people being interested in what I do.

        With that, I see ya next month.
