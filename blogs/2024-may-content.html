        Greetings! 
        This month has been busy in a few matters, as development for things come out,
        I will go through some of these briefly but feel free to ask anything specific.

        A new update for the game has come out, this includes a varities of things,
        such as <span class="highlight">cooking</span>, a slightly nicer map, a new NPC (<span>the one on the image above</span>) 
        that will serve as the actual shopkeeper.
        And available at the github page, its the mostly full <span class="highlight">changelog</span> of things,
         aswell as a roadmap for the current goals.

        It also has finally, a proper desktop icon.

        <h2> Firelight </h2>
<pre>
        Its been hard to keep up with the game, it doesnt help having that need to
        <span class="highlight">refactor the entire again with my newfound knowledge</span>.

        Within next month, if I still have time I would like to resume heavy work with Firelight,
        this would mean AFR will be put in the background unless suddenly it gains attention.

        I would still like to go over how AI for the enemies work sometime along,and go
         over the main gameplay progression as that one has been changing as the months 
        that have gone through

        <h2> Project Mania </h2>
<pre>
        Some progress has been made for the physics movement, and 
        I started the spritework for the characters, still far from
        being showcased but I thought it would be worth mentioning.

        And that is all. It wasnt much but it was what I could do in a month.
        Im happy to see that some people are interested in what I do and
        that motivates me to work even harder for these.

        Hope you have a good day, and see you next post.
