    Games need enemies, you put them to offer a challenge, enemy hits player, 
    they explode, player hits enemy and becomes rich, the usual thing.

    For this to work there is many different things you have to learn but for now,
    I will try to get an in-depth on how AI for enemies here works, and my goals 
    for it (if any).

    Get a seat and a snack to read a long, technical ramble about...

<h2 id="EnemyBehaviour">How do enemies think<a href="#EnemyBehaviour" title="Article Link">¶</a></h2>
<pre>
    I'll gloss over most of the specific details but here is the general method of thinking.

    You want enemy to kill player, it needs:
    1. Know how to hurt it
    2. If needed, walk up to it, avoid obstacles when applicable

    Even with the most simple behaviour, you have to account for anything,
    all of it has to be designed, programed and balanced properly manually,
    and that is when most people get lost.
    
    Don't want your guy to maybe walk into a pit, or run straight into fire,
    maybe it needs tactical defense against something as dumb as standing in
    high ground...

    First, I'll explain how the most basic (and thus far, most developed) enemy works
    in Firelight, the Scoutstruct.

<h2 id="Initial">Starting the behaviour <a href="#Initial" title="Article Link">¶</a></h2>
<pre>
    In order to make first appearences less awkward and more natural, or simply have an opportunity to
    spot the player, enemies have idle cycles through which they wander and do simple
    actions to mimic the passive behaviour of a creature.

    In the case of ours, it's a basic moving around in random points of space near them,
    which then they walk towards, generate a new wander position, and repeat.

    For the detection part, the enemy has an invisible circle around them that spots
    other entities in its vicinities, if these are valid targets then start the chasing,
        Another way of detection is through a sort of "vision", three raycasts are thrown in
    the direction they are looking, they have a further range than the circle but are 
    limited in coverage.

    Now that we have someone as target, we simply move in a straight line towards it,
    in more complicated enemies, they could have different more inteligent chase patterns,
    in this case, we have the player in sight, by casting a line from the enemy and the target.

    But what if said sightline is blocked? Well, in that case we prepare to find our way in

<h2 id="Pathfind">Finding the way<a href="#Pathfind" title="Article Link">¶</a></h2>
<pre>
    The current implementation for pathfinding around is the A Star algorithm, the way it works
    is a bit elaborated so I will try to keep it simple:

    First we create a grid of nodes(tiles) as a map for the path, this is done per enemy to fit
    their needs, let's say small units have a 1:1 tile to node size but larger ones have a 4:1 size
    so it does not try fitting in a smaller cavity than intended.

    Second is establishing the start and end of the path, us and the target, following this, we
    explore the neighbors around the start, for every neighbor explored we do the following:
        - Calculate the distance value between this node and the start
        - Calculate the distance value between this node and the end 
        - Sum both of these and assign the value to the neighbor
        - Set the parent of this neighbor as the main node we branched out of
        - Mark it as explored and therefore, calculated, and add it to a list of explored nodes
    
    Third step, now using the list we gathered, we check for the lowest calculated value in this list,
    once is selected, we go back to the second step and repeat until we find the End node

    Fourth, once you find the end, simply make a list with all of the parents of the nods until you reach back
    to the start, optionally, reverse the list so the next step is the first elements in the list, rather than
    the last ones

    Done! We got a path, that does not include an array of possibilities that can happen while calculating it
    but is pretty much the gist of it, of course, this operation is not done every frame
        For ours, this is done every 10 phyiscs ticks, there is 50 ticks per second for a total of 5 path
    calculations.

<h2 id="Attack">Attacking the player <a href="#Attack" title="Article Link">¶</a></h2>
<pre>
    If we have sight of the target, it's time to prepare a strike
    
    In terms of melee attacks, a distance check is done to see if they are within range,
    our enemy has a slight charge delay to give the player some anticipation
