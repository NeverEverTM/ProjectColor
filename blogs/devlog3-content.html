        I have been pretty <s>hyperfixated</s>busy with AFR to reallly hammer things down on Firelight,
        however, I gathered enough inspiration and experience to later on focus with the project.

        With that, I actually want to go on a brief rant on a particular thing that has been annoying me.
        As a bullet hell, we need bullets, and we need enemies to shoot those bullets.

        How do we do that? By making a piece of bytes intelligent enough to walk to you and beat you
        to a pulp. Or in this case, turn you into a strainer.

        The amount of work for basic manueuvers is already complex and nuanced enough, specially as I wasnt
        that knowledgeable of the area at the time (and still are not but shhh).
            Now making each one of these unique and fun to fight is a whole entire thing,
        not counting the part where the actual shooting you do should be fun.

        So with that let me delve deeper first into the enemies for the first area (and later ones) to be found:
