    In terms of progress, we have no progress <img src="img/toffeeJoy.PNG" alt="moth uvu" width="24" height="24">

    Development has slowed down, both due to personal responsabilities... and motivation.
    With it, I will just highlight some of the highs.

<h2> Aphid Festival Resort</h2>
<pre>
    Currently, Resort customization is a WIP, Im having difficulties getting a proper UX for it,
    I would like to spice up some of the menus with new art, aswell as to implement a proper
    input binding system.

    After this, some more exciting work on the Aphid internals shold be on-going next month,
    this includes the skills system and the foundation for traits.

<h2>Project Mania</h2>
<pre>
    Further work on phyisics is yielding interesting results, still working on spritework.
</pre>

<h2>Firelight</h2>
<pre>
    Ive been trying to lay on an interesting devlog talking about the so hyped up AI systems,
    (Ignore that I have been saying this since April) apart from that, progress is still slow.

    Hopefully I can work on character artwork soon.

    Sorry about the lack of updates on everything, I have been trying to organize how things are
    presented and focusing on single month goals to speed up updates.
    Regardless, I think some very remarkeable things will come out sooner or later.

    So see you next month, who knows, maybe with the next devlog.
