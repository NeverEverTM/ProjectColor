        Welcome back to another blog of me losing my mind. And happy 2025!
    </p>
    <p>
        We are on february and my consistency of doing monthly updates is still piss poor.
    </p>
    <p>
        But here's a quick recap:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a class="highlight" href="https://neverevertm.itch.io/aphid-festival-resort">Aphid Festival Resort 0.2 is out!!</a> More details below.
        </li>
        <li>
            Firelight is in rough shape but I'm not giving up that easily. Things are still cooking! Update coming next month.
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm doing commisssion work now! (I desire the good known as money)<br>
            Up here in the tabs should be everything you need to know. But it'll explain a bit here.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Thanks to all the peeps that are patient with my non-sense schedule, i'm your biggest fan.

        Unfortunately a lot of the major features had to be pushed to the next update, 
        either because they proved too complicated or I ran out of time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't go yet, cause time not spent doing features was spent testing stability, game balance 
        and tweaking an overall far better QOL than previous builds. <br>
        Or atleast I hope it is good!
    </p>
        For now the major aphid change is that personality traits are on and as good as they can be.

        Like I mentioned above I went ahead and moved, renamed, flipped and throw around a buncha stuff in hopes of improving
        user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        A lot of love went into throwing a bit more of life with proper SFX for a lot of interactions, along with the
        implementation of a control prompt, to you know, know what and how you can interact with the resort.
