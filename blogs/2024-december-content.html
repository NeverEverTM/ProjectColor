        Hello! Happy Christmas! Jolly times to be. (This was originally meant for christmas, woops)
    </p>

    <p>
        Last time I said to come back at the end of the month, aaaaand... woops, december!
        Lots of things happened!
    </p>

    <p>
        Mainly, I graduated from university, woooooooooh.

<h2>
    Aphid Festival Resort Update
</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        The game has been updated to Godot 4.3, so there may be some unexpected consequences, but so far it looks like it works fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have pushed major works on the game's infrastrcture, under the hood improvements for the changes to come, and
        while the implementations are still
        a bit green and undergoing testing, I'm glad to say most of it works fine enough!
    </p>
    <span class="highlight">The core of aphid's behaviour has been heavily modified to allow for a more diverse and
        unique personality for the lil guy, this first batch of updates includes Traits!</span>
    <p>
        Traits affect their behaviour in all sorts of fun and different ways...
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li>Maybe your aphid is a picky eater and won't eat food that is not their favorite...</li>
        <li>Or they tend to be lazier and sleep far more than usual</li>
        <li>Or they smarter than the others and can learn skills at a faster pace!</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond this, some other functions are planned to be implemented as the month ends and hopefully
        seen late January, this includes:
    <ul style="color: coral;">
        <li>
            Skills that can be learned and used in tasks(already in-game but are currently unusued)
        </li>
        <li>
            Relationships (Aphids would be able to interact between each other)
        </li>
        <li>
            Likes and Dislikes (Aphids already have favorite flavours, but more favorites are planned to be added and
            further developed)
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <div>

    </div>
    <p>
        What else? A lot of polish and general QoL has been done.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two issues that went unnoticed have been solved, one that made the continue button boot you
        into an empty map (fortunately, this seems to be completely harmless), and heavy peformance issues
        caused by torch lighting, which hopefully is solved or atleast softened.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of my sparetime was spent on retouching some of the menu layouts so they look prettier and become more
        functional overall!
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
        Sound effects have been added to multiple things so the game should be a lot less silent than before, and along
        that,
        new settings to control audio more in general.
    </p>
    <p>
        A lot of work is still underway but I hope to have showcase videos for january!

        Still going strong!

        Whenever I worked on this game, it would be always concept art and design planning since Unity as an editor was
        a bottleneck to deal with.
        As of last week, I have been toying with a few plugins that allow me to easily move the game to Godot!
    </p>
    <p>
        Next year should be a lot more moth game focused while AFR stays on the side, as much fun as I have with the
        aphids,
        I would love to work on my own original content and show you all the crazy ideas I've come up in the past years.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the meantime, enjoy this concept art for the second area of the game!

        I will be out for a few days to take a break and stay with family for the holidays.
        Here's hoping 2025 is just as productive, if not, more than this one.
    </p>
    <p>
        See ya next year!
