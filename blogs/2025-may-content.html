        With todays update, I bring a bit of QoL changes that were really needed back in 2.0. 
        Hopefully by the next two months I can properly work in the big guns for AFR.
    </p>
    <p>
        Until then, here's a brief resume of what's new for v0.2.1!
    </p>

</div>
<h2>
    Generations Album and Aphid Utils
</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        A functionality that was due for a while since the introduction of taking photos. The photo album!
    </p>

    <p>
        The generations menu now has an album where you can see all photos taken, allowing you to even see individual photo albums for each aphid.
    </p>
</div>
<h2>
    Balance Tweaks, Sprite Touchups and Performance Improvements
</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        With a bit of grease and sweat, I got to the game to run more smoothly than last version, I am still finding bottlenecks in some areas but this <br>
        should hopefully soften problems of optimization and thus allow you to have as many aphids as you want.
    </p>
    <p>
        Changes on aphid traits, stats and such have been made. The most noticeable will be a more subtle inheritance of colors unlike last update. <br>
        Hopefully aphid breeding becomes more refined as the updates come along, but I am happy with how things shaped up.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also went ahead and added a <span class="highlight">brand new skin</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Between a few more things, some touchups to overall UX were on the works. This includes rebalancing of food and recipes. <br>
        None of the changes are permanent and require a revision on later updates but these changes should make them less busted than before
    </p>

<h2>
    ???
</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Various foundations for features have been implemented, though I did not have time to have a stable version of these, you should notice some <br>
        changes in aphid behaviour that are to come in play later...
    </p>
