    Hello! It's been a while!

<img class="img-thumbnail-center" style="max-width: 400px;" src="img/cool_image.jpg" alt="Im every bit as cool as Larry, and If Im not, then may I be struck by... [LIGHTNING RUMBLE] A flying ice cream truck! [fiuuuuuuuum]... AND LIVE">

    <p>
        Two months have passed since the last post and i'm not happy about it
    </p>
    <p>
        So, what brews? A bit, not much, still on the last stretch to finish school.
    </p>
</div>

<h2>
Aphid Festival Resort v0.1.3 is now a stable build <img width="40px" height="40px" src="img/toffeeJoy.PNG" alt="">
</h2>
<div>
    <p> Beyond that, a few stuff has been sorted out, particularly the so called small project of mine,
        <a class="highlight" href="https://neverevertm.itch.io/aphid-festival-resort/devlog/830733/stable-v0133-hitting-shelves-today">Aphid Festival Resort</a> 
        has gotten an update so go check that out!
    </p>
    <p>
        It was a pain to get out, thinking it was easy enough, and it in fact was! Like doing a puzzle
        and discovering that the last piece is missing, so you go to the depths of Mordor just to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Simple does not mean easy, I'll tell you much
    </p>
    <p>
        With that juicy link I put up there, you can see an overview for everything that was done
    </p>
    <p>
        The highlights this update are the resort customization and the custom input binds, along a bunch
        of small features and details that little by little make it more cozy.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, there is only two months left of the year, that leaves work for the last part of the
        0.2 update a bit tight, so do not expect much from me, but I will be make sure to <b>ATLEAST</b>
        report back on progress before the year ends.
    </p>

<h2>
    Firelight and future development
</h2>

<div>
    <p>
        With a title as ominous as that, I gotta clarify that progress is still being made at the moment,
        graphics, storywriting and tools are still being developed.
    </p>
    <p>
        But understandably a lot of thigns have got in my way, particularly, stress and lack
        of motivation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been shared a few ways to export the project to Godot from Unity since
        it would be easier for me to work there. So tangible progress will be halted
        until I can get it running again.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the matter, I plan on giving Firelight my all next year with a more clear goal on
        what I want of the game and its overall story.
    </p>
    <p>
        Still expect Devlog 3 to come EVENTUALLY but it'll stop hyping up something
        that is to be honest, just a tech ramble.
    </p>

<h2>Art Commisions? You? Please</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        That's right! I'm opening commissions, and YOU are the first people to know.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will be rolling out this as the month goes but for now, if you are really curious
        and wanna help me test the whole process, please hit me with a dm on Discord.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prices for a full piece (lineart + color + render) will be starting at $30, so keep that in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do check my <a class="highlight" href="/gallery.html">Gallery</a> to see a flavour of my style and how I work!

    <p>
        And that's it, I will lurk back into the depths and throw some bones into making
        things, expect a blog at the end of this month for an update on the situation, both in real life
        and project wise.
    </p>
    <p>But anyways, hope you have a good day and happy late halloween</p>
