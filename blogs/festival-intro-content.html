<h2 id="Intro">First, the demo <a href="#Intro" title="Article Link">¶</a></h2>
<pre>
        With my recent introduction to Godot I have been doing some extra projects on the sidelines.
        Mainly two new ones, and one coming up from the grave. 
        
        But first, I present to you:
        <img src="./img/resort.png" class="img-center">

        A silly fangame of Bug Fables, with a demo releasing next month.

        Inspired by Chao Resort Island. Which you can try here! (Not sponsored)
        <a href="https://nefault1st.wordpress.com/downloads/chao-resort-island/">https://nefault1st.wordpress.com/downloads/chao-resort-island/</a>

        My goals of implementation are as follows:
        - Breeding and the nuances of genetics.
        - Cooking, mostly for fun.
        - Toys for them to play with.
        - Abilities

        As writing of this, the source code for the game should be available here!

        So, for the 2024 plans, there is a lot I have to prepare as I work entirely by myself.
        It is also a busy year in real life as I finish my degree in CS, so expect things to slow down
        as we head deeper into the year.

        Now, let me talk about the ongoing projects to come:

<h2 id="Firelight">Whats up with Firelight? <a href="#Firelight" title="Article Link">¶</a></h2>
<pre>
        This one takes its time to cook, for now Ive been working on enemy AI behaviour, which
        I want to showcase next month along a bit of a technical talk about my concepts.

        For the end goal this year, Im hoping to now FINALLY release a short demo to test combat and exploration,
        but this is still far away.

<h2 id="ProjectMania">Project Mania Concept Tease <a href="#ProjectMania" title="Article Link">¶</a></h2>
<pre>
        I wanted to work on a Godot project alongside Firelight for a good while, though Aphid Festival Resort ended up taking up that slot,
        while not a priority, I still want to go ahead and prepare a small tease for later, since I really liked it as a concept.

        For what it is, its heavily influenced by my time playing Sonic Mania and Sonic CD.

        The three protagonists, in true hedgehog fashion.

<h2 id="ALightAway">Dead game??? <a href="#ALightAway" title="Article Link">¶</a></h2>
<pre>
        A Light Away slowly faded into obscurity as most of the project was doomed to failed.
        Aswell as not being nearly as conceptualized or planned out as Firelight is.
        
        There was also an incident back in december of 2023, which prevented me from working in it further
        for a few months and losing severe progress.

        There is a reason this very web background is ALA related, I never wanted it to be over.

        Now, I want to resume things in Godot, it has the same priority as Project Mania,
        but this time it has been scaled down to a simple puzzle platformer.
        Which I hope, helps.
