        I have said in the previous posts where do I draw my inspiration from, 
        so Im not gonna repeat myself, you can look those up for references that I mention here.

        By the way, Im still open to bug character ideas, both for enemies and characters,
        this early on, things are bound to change a lot so expect some different things from then and now.

        Alright, we start with one who I had already actively shared before,
        this one is about the <span class="highlight">fearsome butterfly warrior, Saria!</span>.
        
        <h4 class="container-purple" style="text-align: center;">
            At first, she can be seen as rather cold and distant, however, not only are their loyal to their people.
            But once one gets to know her, Saria can be a sweetheart of a person and a loveable gal at that.
        </h4>

        Saria is what invited me to change the initial design of the story, I dont remember what was she supposed to be
        but I knew I wanted her to be a reflection of Toffees own dilemma, as well as the one to test your abilities.

        Your very first encounter with anything else that is not a wild animal, is her.

        The design is loosely based off Hornet, but personality wise, shes a leader first and foremost, and a friend when needed.
        The species is the Sarota Jewelmark, some kind of butterfly gene that I discovered while browsing for concepts.

        Toffee is a weird character, as I was protopying a character thinking on the "white blob, black eyes" standard that somehow exists, I came to this:
        <img src="./img/chara.PNG" class="img-center">
        <span class="highlight">What is this?</span> I asked myself, at that time the idea of a bug world was not really in my mind, and it would not be an idea for long, 
        but I guess something, somewhere asked me to turn it real, so I did.

        Toffee knows nothing about this world, nor herself once she wakes up, and weirdly, the main driving narrative for the first half of the game.

        It is not based on any species of bugs, simply a random stroke of paint, I call em dustling internally, from dust bunnies.

        And now, a few sparks of designs, some finished, others not.
        I dont really draw concept art much but I will try to more often do for the sake of this devlogs!

        For next month, I will bring some of the tech details about how enemy behaviour works, aswell as some other
        things such as how the player interacts with the world. Hopefully its more interesting than this brief entry.

        And with that, good night.
