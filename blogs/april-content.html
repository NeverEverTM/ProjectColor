    I been doing a few tests for stability, but apart from that, the game is still a small
    proof of concept that I would like to develop alongside my actual main original
    projects.

    I gotta say, this lil project has been eye-opening on how to approach game making,
    and has helped me get a hand on Godots structure (though, its still obscure when it wants)

    Anyways, now what about my other work.

    Due to the work in AFR, Firelight programming-wise wasnt as fruitful as I would have wanted to, <img width="30" height="25" src="./img/toffeeShock.png">
    however, what I was able to do, was setting up more complex pathfinding behaviours and
    building up the modular system for the future, which has helped refining previous AIs.

    I also have wrote down and designed various enemy concepts that need some revisions
    before I am able to settle down on a small selection of them.
        And while I was at it, develop further references for more characters to come.

   More elements of it have been underlined and shaped in the GDD, so hopefully,
   somewhat soon, I can resume work on it.

    For Project Mania I do have some working physics and assets on the way already,
    though not as finished to do a showdown of them.
    Level design is waiting on these key aspects but I have a rough idea of how
    I want to take these.

    Unfortunately, not much more than that.

    This blog has also been quite shorter and not what I said it would be,
    and Im sorry for that, I dont have much of an excuse apart from
    beeing distracted by a lot of stuff, but hey, things have been going well enough
    so Im excited to show people something for once!

    Like always, take care and see you later. <img width="30" height="25" src="./img/toffeeJoy.png" alt="aphids">
