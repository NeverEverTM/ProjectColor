    <span class="highlight">Devlog 3</span> has been in the works for a while and is almost fully done!
     It was fairly easier to get it done after organizing through the mess that is the codebase.

    Concerning the actual game, a lot of under the hood fixes have been done, along with
    a fresh coat of paint for certain elements like backgrounds, tilesets, characters, 
    and, started to experiment by adding <span class="highlight">SFX and Music</span> to the whole ordeal.

    I'm hoping to keep this line of work for a few more months until I feel there is
    something worth showing, tho I gotta say, I like it thus far.

<h2 id="AFR">Aphid Festival Resort 1.3 Update <a href="#AFR" title="Article Link">¶</a></h2>
<pre>
    It's been a long workload for the new update, and far more work than I thought,
    however that does not mean it has been the only thing being worked on.
    <img class="img-thumbnail-center" src="img/july_deco.png">
    Some small QoL improvements like a change in controls, adding in some key and button shortcuts,
    <span class="highlight">fixing issues that went unnoticed like light affecting UI</span> (this is why you do proper testing).
    
    <img class="img-thumbnail-center" src="img/july_load.PNG">

    With each new update, I would like to introduce a few trinkets, recipes, items and structures so content-wise
    the game has a least a lil something every month rather than like what happened with this one,
    starting with this hopefully coming next month one, some initial furniture such as the one you
    see already in-game should be available to mess around with.

    I talked about how a <span class="highlight">screenshot function</span> was added last month, along with the free camera mode,
    that should allow a better check in things within the resort.

    After a lot of trouble with getting accounts and cards to connect, I finally

    a ko-fi, or wanna do some silly shenanigans for a price, make sure to hit me up!
