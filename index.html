            Hello! I'm Summer, solo game developer in-training, currently developing two titles:
            <span style="color:#2002c7">A Light Away</span>, a linear story-driven precision platformer with a (hopefully) fully working level editor.
            And <span style="color:#ce7500">Firelight</span>, an action adventure bullet-hell metroidvania.

            A lot of my time is spent this two things, mainly because of my ample free time between college,
            I started this sort of web-blog to centralize all related media that I work on, less personal projects, more commercial games.
            
            Here I will try sharing details and closeups to the games, aswell as to give me a place to drop off my thoughts,
            Soon enough, I wil set a <span style="color:#ce1f00">Kofi</span> and <span style="color:#ce1f00">Itch.io</span> pages in order to give an opportunity to help the workload,
                regardless, you are still able to drop feedback or complains at our discord server linked right above here!

        <h4 style="text-align: left;"><pre>     About myself </pre></h4>
        <pre>
            Already stated my name before but some formalities.
            My username is NeverEver(TM) and I have been an aspiring gamedev for a few years now,
            developed a few small things like mods and personal builds in order to gather experience.

            I'm a closeted transgirl, so there is that! :)
