        Hello! I'm Never, solo game developer in-training, currently developing:
        <span class="highlight">Firelight</span>, an action adventure bullet-hell metroidvania.
        Also but in the backburner:
        <span class="highlight">A Light Away</span>, a linear story-driven precision platformer with a (hopefully) fully working level editor.

        A lot of my time is spent in game dev, mainly because of my ample free time between college,
        I started this web-blog to centralize all related media that I work on, less personal projects, more commercial games.
            
        Here I will try sharing annoucements and close-ups, aswell as any change done to these,
        Soon enough, I will set a <span class="highlight">Kofi</span> and <span class="highlight">Itch.io</span> pages so look up for that!
        regardless, you are still able to drop feedback or complains at our <span class="highlight">discord server</span> linked right above here.

        <pre>
        Mainly known as NeverEver(TM) in ther inter-webs but my (not real) name is Summer.

        I have done modding and have done some silly unity projects, it is now that I have taken more seriously my career and want to prove that!
        Always been fascinated by game development and design, so here I am, suffering one line of code at a time.
        My likes on games are varied but my main genres are survivals and open worlds.
        Thinking of doing commisions to get some budget. So if you are interested, hit me up, why dont ya.

        In Firelight you play as a small moth called Toffee, waking up in a mysterious forgotten cave, 
        traverse kingdoms and towns through the underground cavern, meet colorful friends and foes, and may the light guide your way.

        A bullet hell action adventure metroidvania, a more frentic style of combat mixed with inmersive exploration.

        The world will consist of three main mega-zones, made up of other various sub-areas, secrets everywhere you go
        and of course, enemies to defeat in combat, be it though foes or bosses.

        In terms of progression, there would be more-or-less a linear path of beating the story, 
        however, if im able to, I would like to let the player choose their way, via designing difficulty around player level and skill. 
        Perhaps even certain items helping you on a different area if done first...
        
        Apart from the obvious ways of player progression in a metroidvania, you will also have a medal skill tree to work with.
        Level up to become stronger, and find medals with all sorts of effects, upragde them, and branch them out.

        A few inspirations for this game has been:
        * Hollow Knight for its vast cavern system thatinvited you to explore an unknown world full of adventure.
        * Bug Fables, both in story and character writting, a more lightheartead, yet profound dialogue between characters and 
            memorable interactions.
        * Crosscode for its amazing combat system, a personalized journey of new powers and abilities that unlock as you go through.

        Less to say that I recommend anyone to try out those amazing indie gems, specially the last two, those go very unnoticed :)

        In A Light Away, you play as Will, who is visiting his grandmother resting place at the top of Mount Reyn, 
        just to see her one last time. Along the way you will meet Wisp, a stubborn yet joyful light gal
        who wants to see the aurora event at the top, that only happens once a century.
        A journey not quite easy mind you, but one they are willing to take.

        Climb the mountain in this simple percision platformer, face the dangers that are thrown at you, 
        and meet nice (and not so nice) people in your way.
        A story-driven campaign with various levels composed of hundreds of rooms full of challenges and secrets.

        And to top it off, a level editor! Yeah, I did not think about how big those two words are...
        Currently, A Light Away is on pause, as I develop Firelight, and get myself into the nitty-gritty of game dev.
        A lot of systems are in place, some others not so much, but it has been burnt me so much I needed a break from it.

        Definitely not anytime soon, but you will surely hear from time to time how I hammer things into place.
        If you want more of those, be sure to be on the discord for when I shadow-drop info on it!
        Otherwise, feel free to wait until the "In Development" appears on it here in the website :3

            Project Color is NOT a company (yet), but rather a way for me, NeverEver, to encapsulate all of my work,
            like some sort of portafolio but cooler and... I think they do this already.

            Here you can access official contacts to get to me, aswell as main accounts to market
            and follow the progress of any project you are interested in.
            This ones go as follows:
            
            ° <span class="highlight">Discord</span> server where you can see me share all my rants about how I get stuck at two lines of code for 30 minutes.
                Oh, and I guess talk with other members too, if that is your thing.
            ° <span class="highlight">Youtube</span> channel where I will post annoucements and teasers for anything that comes!
                Not planning on doing dev streams for the moment, sorry!
            ° <span class="highlight">Devianart</span> account where I share... my art, but also some things related to the projects!
            Yeah, sorry, Wont make a separate account for these.

            Any concerns, make sure to voice them around!
            Also sorry there is no comments in here, did not have time to figure that out...
